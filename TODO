- List of exclusion terms
- Add Read and CTV3 searching as well
  e.g. to find Dozine from Chlorpromazine
- EMIS?
- including hyphenated terms
  - Examples
    - Chlordiazepoxide leads to suggestion of Limbitrol-5 - but here I think we should just match limbitrol
    - Aspirin lead to suggestion of nu-seals - would want to search for nu and seals
- avoid extra words like \*zileze (if search for Zopiclone) - strip the "\*" and deduplicate
- the extra terms jump around if you include/exclude - also the width of the button changes
- height of scrollable area needs updating better
- more exclusions for read/ctv3
  - poisoning$
  - poisoning of undetermined intent$
  - allergy$
  - overdose$
  - overdose of undetermined intent$
  - OR just do it based on first letter for Read code, and ?? for ctv3
